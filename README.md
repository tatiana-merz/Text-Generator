## Natural Language Processing

Embark upon this track to get the essential skills of working with text data using Python. Texts constitute the lion's share of all information stored on the Internet and beyond. This track will equip you with the right tools not only to process, filter, and analyze text data, but also to scrape it from the Internet, generate texts yourself, and extract from them useful information such as key terms and opinions. To make the process even more fun, some of the projects have been implemented as games, so join without a doubt!
